### **1. Introduction**

Function transformation—modifying the definition or behavior of existing functions dynamically—is a powerful technique in programming. It allows for injecting additional behavior (like logging) without altering the original function's source code directly. This report delves into how this can be achieved in three distinct languages: **Guile (a Scheme implementation)**, **Hy (a Lisp dialect for Python)**, and **Python (using the `ast` module)**. We will explore the methodologies, compare their effectiveness, and discuss the inherent limitations of each approach.

---

### **2. Methodologies for Function Transformation**

#### **2.1. Guile (Scheme)**

**Guile** is an implementation of the Scheme programming language, a minimalist dialect of Lisp. Scheme's homoiconicity—the property that code is represented as data structures (lists)—facilitates easy code manipulation.

**Guile Implementation Highlights:**

- **Parsing and Manipulation**: Functions are defined as s-expressions (lists). Guile can parse a function definition string into a list, extract components, and reconstruct the function with additional expressions (like logging) inserted.
  
- **Quasiquoting**: Scheme's quasiquoting (\``) and unquoting (, and ,@) allow for elegant template-based code generation, making the insertion of logging statements straightforward.

- **Evaluation Environment**: Guile's `eval` function can evaluate transformed code within a specified environment (e.g., `interaction-environment`), ensuring that the new definitions are immediately available.

**Advantages:**

- **Simplicity**: Guile's native handling of s-expressions makes code manipulation intuitive.
- **Direct Manipulation**: Code can be directly manipulated as lists without needing intermediate representations.
- **Powerful Macros**: Scheme's macro system allows for advanced compile-time code transformations.

**Limitations:**

- **Scheme Syntax**: Requires familiarity with Scheme's syntax and semantics, which may differ significantly from other languages.

---

#### **2.2. Hy (Lisp for Python)**

**Hy** is a Lisp dialect embedded in Python. It leverages Python's ecosystem while providing Lisp's powerful macros and syntax.

**Hy Implementation Highlights:**

- **Expression Representation**: While Hy represents code as Python objects (`hy.models.Expression`, `hy.models.Symbol`, etc.), the final implementation demonstrates that direct manipulation of these objects isn't necessary. Instead, similar to Guile's approach, Hy code utilizes quasiquoting and destructuring to handle transformations elegantly.

- **Quasiquoting**: Hy supports quasiquoting (`\``) with unquoting (`~`) and unquote-splicing (`~@`), allowing for clear and concise template-based code generation.

- **Evaluation**: Hy's `eval` interacts seamlessly with Python's evaluation environment, enabling the transformed code to be executed within Python's runtime.

**Final Working Hy Code:**

```hy
(import hy.reader [read-many])
(import hy [eval])

;; Define the function that inserts a log expression into the function definition
;; read-many returns generator, next assumes the first sexp will be the single fn we want
(defn add-logging [func-string log-expression]
  ;; Parse the function string into a Hy expression and destructure using `let`
  (let [[_ name params #* body] (next (read-many func-string))]
    ;; Reconstruct the function definition with the log statement inserted
    `(defn ~name ~params
       ~log-expression
       ~@body)))

;; Original function as a string to convert
(setv foo-string "(defn foo [x] (print x) (+ x x))")  ; Function definition as a string

;; Define the log expression using natural Hy code
(setv inject-code '(print "Executing foo"))

;; Add logging to the function
(setv transformed-exp
  (add-logging foo-string
               inject-code))  ; Ensure quotes remain intact

;; Show the transformed code for debugging
(print transformed-exp)

;; Evaluate the transformed function definition
(eval transformed-exp)

;; Test the transformed function.
;; Expected Output:
;; Executing foo
;; 10
;; 20
(print (foo 10))
```

**Advantages:**

- **Idiomatic Lisp Syntax**: Retains Lisp's powerful syntax and macro capabilities within the Python ecosystem.
- **Clarity and Conciseness**: With proper destructuring and quasiquoting, the transformation code is clear and maintains conciseness comparable to Guile.

**Limitations:**

- **Type Constraints**: Hy's strict type system between Python lists and Hy's `Expression` objects requires careful construction of transformed code.
- **Error-Prone Transformations**: Manual reconstruction using quasiquoting can lead to syntax or type errors if not meticulously managed.

---

#### **2.3. Python (Using AST)**

Python's `ast` module allows for parsing, analyzing, and modifying Python code as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). This approach provides a powerful way to perform code transformations programmatically.

**Python Implementation Highlights:**

- **AST Parsing**: Python can parse code strings into ASTs, manipulate the tree, and then compile and execute the modified code.
  
- **Flexibility**: The `ast` module provides comprehensive tools for traversing and modifying Python code structures.
  
- **Integration with Python Ecosystem**: Leveraging Python's native capabilities allows for seamless integration with existing Python codebases.

**Final Working Python Code Using AST:**

```python
import ast

# Adds a logging expression to the beginning of a function definition.
def add_logging(func_string, log_expression):
    # Parse the function string into an AST
    func_ast = ast.parse(func_string)

    # Assuming the function is the first node in the module
    func_def = func_ast.body[0]
    if not isinstance(func_def, ast.FunctionDef):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a valid function definition.")

    # Insert the log expression at the beginning of the function body
    func_def.body.insert(0, log_expression)
    # Convert the modified AST back to code
    transformed_code = ast.unparse(func_ast)

    return transformed_code

# Original function as a string
foo_string = """
def foo(x):
    print(x)
    return x + x
"""

# Create a generic logging expression
inject_code = ast.Expr(
    value=ast.Call(
        func=ast.Name(id="print", ctx=ast.Load()),
        args=[ast.Constant(value="Executing foo")],
        keywords=[]
    )
)

# Add logging to the function
transformed_fn = add_logging(foo_string, inject_code)

# Show the code for debugging
print(transformed_fn)

# Evaluate the transformed function definition
exec(transformed_fn)

# Test the transformed function.
# Expected Output:
# Executing foo
# 10
# 20
print(foo(10))
```

**Advantages:**

- **Powerful Manipulation**: Python's `ast` module provides a robust way to parse and manipulate code structures.
  
- **Native Integration**: Since it's part of Python's standard library, it integrates seamlessly without needing external dependencies.
  
- **Flexibility**: Allows for complex transformations, including adding, removing, or modifying statements and expressions.

**Limitations:**

- **Verbosity**: Manipulating ASTs can be more verbose and complex compared to Guile's list-based manipulations.
  
- **Error Handling**: Requires careful handling to ensure that the transformed AST remains syntactically and semantically correct.
  
- **Performance**: AST transformations can introduce overhead, especially for large codebases or frequent transformations.
