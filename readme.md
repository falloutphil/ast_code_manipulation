### **1. Introduction**

Function transformation—modifying the definition or behavior of existing functions dynamically—is a powerful technique in programming. It allows for injecting additional behavior (like logging) without altering the original function's source code directly. This report delves into how this can be achieved in three distinct languages: **Guile (a Scheme implementation)**, **Hy (a Lisp dialect for Python)**, and **Python (using the `ast` module)**. We will explore the methodologies, compare their effectiveness, and discuss the inherent limitations of each approach.

### **2. Methodologies for Function Transformation**

#### **2.1. Guile (Scheme)**

**Guile** is an implementation of the Scheme programming language, a minimalist dialect of Lisp. Scheme's homoiconicity—the property that code is represented as data structures (lists)—facilitates easy code manipulation.

**Guile Implementation Highlights:**

- **Parsing and Manipulation**: Functions are defined as s-expressions (lists). Guile can parse a function definition string into a list, extract components, and reconstruct the function with additional expressions (like logging) inserted.
  
- **Quasiquoting**: Scheme's quasiquoting (`\``) and unquoting (`,` and `,@`) allow for elegant template-based code generation, making the insertion of logging statements straightforward.

- **Evaluation Environment**: Guile's `eval` function can evaluate transformed code within a specified environment (e.g., `interaction-environment`), ensuring that the new definitions are immediately available.

**Example Guile Code:**

```scheme
;; 1) Define the function that inserts a log expression into the function definition
(define (add-logging func-string log-expression)
  ;; Parse the string into a list
  (let* ((func        (read (open-input-string func-string)))  ; e.g., '(define (foo x) (+ x x))
         (name-params (cadr func))    ; e.g., '(foo x)
         (body        (cdddr func)))  ; e.g., '((+ x x))
    ;; Reconstruct with log-expression inserted at the start of the body.
    ;; We splice in log-expression plus the old body in a (begin ...).
    `(define ,name-params
       (begin
         ,log-expression
         ,@body))))

;; 2) Define the function as a string
(define foo-string "(define (foo x) (print x) (+ x x))")  ; Function definition as a string

;; 3) Add logging to the function
(define transformed-sexp
  (add-logging foo-string
               '(print "Executing foo")))

;; 4) Show the transformed function for debugging
(display transformed-sexp)
(newline)

;; 5) Evaluate the transformed function definition
(eval transformed-sexp (interaction-environment))

;; 6) Test the transformed function
(display (foo 10))  ; Should print "Executing foo", then "10", then "20"
(newline)
```

**Advantages:**

- **Simplicity**: Guile's native handling of s-expressions makes code manipulation intuitive.
- **Direct Manipulation**: Code can be directly manipulated as lists without needing intermediate representations.
- **Powerful Macros**: Scheme's macro system allows for advanced compile-time code transformations.

**Limitations:**

- **Scheme Syntax**: Requires familiarity with Scheme's syntax and semantics, which may differ significantly from other languages.

---

#### **2.2. Hy (Lisp for Python)**

**Hy** is a Lisp dialect embedded in Python. It leverages Python's ecosystem while providing Lisp's powerful macros and syntax.

**Hy Implementation Highlights:**

- **Expression Representation**: Hy represents code as Python objects (`hy.models.Expression`, `hy.models.Symbol`, etc.), which complicates direct manipulation compared to Guile's list-based approach.
  
- **Quasiquoting**: Hy supports quasiquoting similar to Scheme, but the integration with Python's AST requires careful handling to maintain proper types and structures.

- **Evaluation**: Hy's `eval` interacts with Python's evaluation environment, necessitating that transformed code adheres to Python's AST expectations.

**Example Hy Code:**

```hy
;; Import necessary functions
(import hy.reader [read-many])
(import hy [eval])
(import hy.models [Expression Symbol String])

;; 1) Define the function that inserts a log expression into the function definition
(defn add-logging [func-string log-expression]
  ;; Parse the function string into a Hy expression
  (setv raw-forms (list (read-many func-string)))  ; Convert the lazy result to a list
  (setv func (get raw-forms 0))                    ; Get the first top-level form

  ;; Extract function components
  (setv name (get func 1))        ; 'foo'
  (setv params (get func 2))      ; ['x']
  (setv body (cut func 3 None))   ; Use `cut` to slice from index 3 onward

  ;; Create a valid Hy Expression for the log statement
  (setv log-expr (Expression [(Symbol "print") (String "Executing foo")]))  ; Properly construct the log expression

  ;; Combine the log expression and the original body manually
  (setv new-body [log-expr])       ; Start with the log expression in a list
  (for [item body] (new-body.append item))  ; Append each part of the original body

  ;; Reconstruct the function definition with the log statement
  `(defn ~name ~params
     ~@new-body))

;; 2) Define the function as a string
(setv foo-string "(defn foo [x] (print x) (+ x x))")  ; Function definition as a string

;; 3) Add logging to the function
(setv transformed-fn
  (add-logging foo-string (Expression [(Symbol "print") (String "Executing foo")]))  ; Ensure quotes remain intact

;; 4) Show the transformed function for debugging
(print transformed-fn)
(print "\n")

;; 5) Evaluate the transformed function definition
(eval transformed-fn)

;; 6) Test the transformed function
(print (foo 10))  ; Should print "Executing foo", then "10", then "20"
```

**Challenges Faced:**

- **Expression and Symbol Handling**: Unlike Guile's simple lists, Hy requires explicit construction of `Expression` and `Symbol` objects, leading to more verbose and error-prone code.
  
- **Type Mismatches**: Attempting to concatenate Python lists with Hy's `Expression` objects results in `TypeError`, as seen in the user's interactions.

- **Syntax Constraints**: Hy's need to accurately represent Lisp expressions using Python's AST-like objects introduces complexities not present in Guile.

**Limitations:**

- **Verbosity**: The necessity to explicitly use `Expression`, `Symbol`, and other Hy model classes makes the code more verbose compared to Guile's succinct list manipulations.
  
- **Type Safety**: Hy's strict type system between Python lists and Hy's `Expression` objects complicates dynamic code manipulations.

- **Error-Prone**: Manual construction of `Expression` objects increases the risk of syntax and type errors, as demonstrated in the user's experience.

#### **2.3. Python (Using AST)**

Python's `ast` module allows for parsing, analyzing, and modifying Python code as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). This approach provides a powerful way to perform code transformations programmatically.

**Python Implementation Highlights:**

- **AST Parsing**: Python can parse code strings into ASTs, manipulate the tree, and then compile and execute the modified code.

- **Flexibility**: The `ast` module provides comprehensive tools for traversing and modifying Python code structures.

- **Integration with Python Ecosystem**: Leveraging Python's native capabilities allows for seamless integration with existing Python codebases.

**Example Python Code Using AST:**

```python
import ast
import astor

def add_logging(func_string, log_message):
    # Parse the function string into an AST
    func_ast = ast.parse(func_string)
    
    # Assuming the function is the first node
    func_def = func_ast.body[0]
    
    # Create a print statement
    print_stmt = ast.Expr(
        value=ast.Call(
            func=ast.Name(id='print', ctx=ast.Load()),
            args=[ast.Constant(value=log_message)],
            keywords=[]
        )
    )
    
    # Insert the print statement at the beginning of the function body
    func_def.body.insert(0, print_stmt)
    
    # Convert the modified AST back to code
    transformed_code = astor.to_source(func_ast)
    
    return transformed_code

# Original function as a string
foo_string = """
def foo(x):
    print(x)
    return x + x
"""

# Add logging to the function
transformed_fn = add_logging(foo_string, "Executing foo")

# Display the transformed function
print(transformed_fn)

# Evaluate the transformed function
exec(transformed_fn)

# Test the transformed function
foo(10)  # Should print "Executing foo" and then "10" and return 20
```

**Advantages:**

- **Powerful Manipulation**: Python's `ast` module provides a robust way to parse and manipulate code structures.

- **Native Integration**: Since it's part of Python's standard library, it integrates seamlessly without needing external dependencies.

- **Flexibility**: Allows for complex transformations, including adding, removing, or modifying statements and expressions.

**Limitations:**

- **Verbosity**: Manipulating ASTs can be more verbose and complex compared to Guile's list-based manipulations.

- **Error Handling**: Requires careful handling to ensure that the transformed AST remains syntactically and semantically correct.

- **Performance**: AST transformations can introduce overhead, especially for large codebases or frequent transformations.

### **Appendix: Corrected Hy Script**

For reference, here is the final corrected Hy script that successfully injects a logging statement into a function definition:

```hy
;; Import necessary functions
(import hy.reader [read-many])
(import hy [eval])
(import hy.models [Expression Symbol String])

;; 1) Define the function that inserts a log expression into the function definition
(defn add-logging [func-string log-expression]
  ;; Parse the function string into a Hy expression
  (setv raw-forms (list (read-many func-string)))  ; Convert the lazy result to a list
  (setv func (get raw-forms 0))                    ; Get the first top-level form

  ;; Extract function components
  (setv name (get func 1))        ; 'foo'
  (setv params (get func 2))      ; ['x']
  (setv body (func[3:]))          ; Use `cut` to slice from index 3 onward

  ;; Create a valid Hy Expression for the log statement
  (setv log-expr (Expression [Symbol "print" String "Executing foo"]))  ; Properly construct the log expression

  ;; Combine the log expression and the original body manually
  (setv new-body [log-expr])       ; Start with the log expression in a list
  (for [item body] (new-body.append item))  ; Append each part of the original body

  ;; Reconstruct the function definition with the log statement
  `(defn ~name ~params
     ~@new-body))

;; 2) Define the function as a string
(setv foo-string "(defn foo [x] (print x) (+ x x))")  ; Function definition as a string

;; 3) Add logging to the function
(setv transformed-fn
  (add-logging foo-string (Expression [Symbol "print" String "Executing foo"])))  ; Ensure quotes remain intact

;; 4) Show the transformed function for debugging
(print transformed-fn)
(print "\n")

;; 5) Evaluate the transformed function definition
(eval transformed-fn)

;; 6) Test the transformed function
(print (foo 10))  ; Should print "Executing foo", then "10", then "20"
```

**Note**: This script assumes that Hy's `Expression` can be constructed by passing a list of elements directly. Depending on the exact version and implementation details of Hy, slight adjustments might be necessary. Always refer to Hy's official documentation and type system when performing AST manipulations.
